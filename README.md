# ![TockLoader](http://www.tockos.org/assets/img/tockloader.svg#a "Tockloader Logo")

This is a work-in-progress port to Rust for Tock Loader.

Please use the original Python version of [TockLoader](https://www.github.com/tock/tockloader).

## Adding support for a new board

If you want to add support for a new board, you have 3 options:

1. Implement support for the bootloader for your board. For this, please see the
[tock-bootloader](https://github.com/tock/tock-bootloader/tree/master) repo for more details.
   > Note: this approach will limit you to use the bootloader for all operations (using the
   > `--serial` flag).
2. Add support for your board in
[probe-rs](https://github.com/probe-rs/probe-rs?tab=readme-ov-file#adding-targets). This should be a
straight-forward process if a CMSIS packs is available for your board.
3. Implement a custom debug probe for your board. This is the most complex option, but it will give
you the most flexibility:
    - First, add your debug probe to the `Connect` enum in `tockloader-lib/src/connection.rs`.
    - Then, implement each command individually. There is no predefined interface for this, as debug probes
      can be very different from each other. You can take a look at the existing implementations for inspiration, and feel free to contact us if you need help.
